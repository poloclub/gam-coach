    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <img class='emoji' src='https://i.imgur.com/0AJHckE.png'>
      Hello! We are a team of computer science researchers. Thank you so much for taking your time to help
      us improve our tool, GAM Coach.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might have heard that some banks
      <img class='emoji' src='https://i.imgur.com/FthIB2T.png'>
      are using Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) to decide whether a person can or cannot get a loan.
      These banks ask for the loan applicant's information, such as <u>annual income</u>,
      <u>employment length</u>, and <u>credit score</u>.
      Then, the banks use AI programs to go through all collected
      information and decide on whether to <strong>approve or reject this client's loan application</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, many people's loan applications are rejected by these programs.
      <img class='emoji' src='https://i.imgur.com/RfnVhdV.png'>
      Therefore, we are developing GAM Coach, an interactive coaching tool to <strong>help
      these rejected loan applicants succeed in their future applications!</strong>
      <img class='emoji' src='https://i.imgur.com/3IJ5vun.png'>
      To do that, GAM Coach identifies an applicant's current weakness and provides simple and customizable strategies
      to get their next loan application approved.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this task, we want you to <strong>pretend to be a person whose loan application is rejected by a bank</strong>.
      The bank points you to GAM Coach to help you improve and succeed in future applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class='important'>
        It is very important to try your best to imagine that you are a real user—using GAM Coach to find
        the strategies that <strong>you think are useful</strong>.
      </span>
      <span>
        Our goal in this study is to learn what strategies would be helpful for real users and how GAM Coach can help everyday people.
